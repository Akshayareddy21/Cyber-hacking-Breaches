## Introduction
Cyber breaches have been increasing in frequency, posing significant threats to organizations. This project utilizes a dataset spanning 12 years (2005â€“2017) of cyber hacking activities, employing stochastic processes and machine learning models to predict breach occurrences and their severity.

## Features
- Statistical analysis of breach data
- Prediction of cyber hacking breaches using machine learning (Support Vector Machine)
- Data visualization using charts and graphs
- Secure data access and user authentication
- Trend analysis of cyber threats

## System Architecture
The system follows a client-server architecture with Django as the backend framework and MySQL as the database. The frontend is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for visualization.
